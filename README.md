# Netties

> An interactive playground for interaction nets and Lafont's interaction combinators.

Netties is a visual tool that lets you build, explore, and simulate interaction nets right in your browser. Since this is a full frontend application rather than a library, the best way to understand what it can do is to just try it out!

## Development

Netties is built with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

To run it locally:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Codebase Tour

For those interested in how it works under the hood:

- `src/core` — The engine: nets, systems, reduction, port types, components, and the combinator translation.
- `src/layout` — Automatic placement and wire routing algorithms.
- `src/anim` — Step animation from the engine's wire lineage.
- `src/render` — SVG paths and standalone SVG export.
- `src/state` — The net model and the editor store.
- `src/ui` — SolidJS UI components.

## Native reflection research

The current feasibility investigation is in
[research/native-reflection](research/native-reflection/README.md). It includes
an explicit specification, a locality obstruction for reflection of arbitrary
normal graphs including deadlocked cycles, and reproducible experiments on
graph wiring, quotation, self-inspection, and duplication.

```sh
npm run research:reflection
npm run research:reflection:check
```

The earlier TC-oriented Lean implementation remains archived in the adjacent
`boom` checkout and is excluded from its default build.
